# ALX Listing App

The **ALX Listing App** is a foundational scaffold for a modern Airbnb clone. It sets up a robust and scalable codebase using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**, providing the perfect starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing application.

## Project Goals

- Scaffold a professional-grade project with **Next.js 13+**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.
- Implement **reusable components** with a clean and scalable folder structure.
- Enforce **code quality** using ESLint and best practices.
- Lay the groundwork for a real-world **Airbnb-style listing platform**.
