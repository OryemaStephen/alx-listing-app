# ALX Listing App

## Description
The ALX Listing App is a web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to display property listings with a clean and reusable UI. The project uses React with TypeScript to create a scalable and maintainable codebase for showcasing property details in a card-based layout.

## Project Goals

- Scaffold a professional-grade project with **Next.js 13+**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.
- Implement **reusable components** with a clean and scalable folder structure.
- Enforce **code quality** using ESLint and best practices.
- Lay the groundwork for a real-world **Airbnb-style listing platform**.

## Project Structure
- **`components/common/`**: Contains reusable UI components.
  - `Card.tsx`: A reusable card component to display property information (e.g., image, title, price).
  - `Button.tsx`: A reusable button component for actions like "Book Now" or "View Details".
- **`interfaces/`**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
  - `index.ts`: Contains interfaces like `CardProps` and `ButtonProps`.
- **`constants/`**: Stores reusable constants such as API URLs and UI text.
  - `index.ts`: Defines constants like `API_URL` and `UI_TEXT`.
- **`public/assets/`**: Stores static assets like images and SVGs for property listings.
